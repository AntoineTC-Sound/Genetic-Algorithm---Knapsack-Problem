The Knapsack Problem is a classic optimization problem that can be succinctly described as trying to pack the most valuable items into a knapsack without exceeding its weight limit. Each item has a specific weight and value, and the goal is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack while staying within the weight constraint.

Genetic Algorithms (GAs) offer a heuristic method to solve the Knapsack Problem by simulating the process of natural selection. Here's a code solution explanation of how GAs can be applied to the Knapsack Problem
